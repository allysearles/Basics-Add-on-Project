		<h1>K9 Connection</h1>
		<h2>A Passion Of Mine</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to my website! My passion for dogs and K-9 training has been a
			driving force in my life, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
			As a dedicated volunteer at Guiding Eyes For The Blind in the Finger Lakes
			Region of Ithaca, NY, I have had the incredible opportunity to raise and
			train three remarkable Labrador Retriever service dogs. Each week, I
			eagerly participated in rigorous trainings and testing, honing my skills
			alongside these incredible companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am immensely proud to say that two out of the three dogs I trained
			successfully achieved their full certification, a testament to our
			unwavering dedication and strong bond. Witnessing their transformation
			from enthusiastic pups to skilled service dogs was an indescribable joy.
			One of my exceptional canines even went on to pursue Autism for Kids
			training, furthering their impact in the lives of others.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to my work at Guiding Eyes For The Blind, I also devoted my
			time as a volunteer at the Horseheads Animal Shelter in Horseheads, NY.
			From 2008 to 2011, I served as a media manager and actively facilitated
			the socialization of shelter dogs to enhance their chances of finding
			forever homes. I walked newly rescued dogs and provided valuable
			assistance to the shelter staff, ensuring their needs were met and that
			they received proper treat preparation.
		</p>
		<p>
			My love for K-9 training goes beyond a mere hobby; it is a fundamental
			part of who I am. The connection I form with these incredible animals, the
			joy of witnessing their growth and transformation, and the ability to make
			a positive impact in the lives of others through their training is an
			experience I cherish deeply.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you join me on this
			incredible journey of canine companionship and K-9 training. Together, we
			can celebrate the extraordinary bond between humans and dogs while making
			a difference in the world, one paw at a time.
